## Tokenomics TON CON

The proposed TON CON model provides for the presence of 4 types of jetton and an NFT management jetton:
1. TON CON is a jetton of economic project management. Jetton can be obtained in several ways:
a. Financing of the DAO, purchase through an AMM contract, purchase of NFT.
b. Active participation in the work of the DAO as a developer.

2. Donation - a basic liquid token to encourage developers. Donation can be obtained in several ways:
  a. Buy
  b. Receive as a reward for the work
done 
  c. Receive for the development of educational and other products
  d. Receive as a reward for contributing to the community
  e. Airdrop
  f. Bounty program

3. Svet - reputation jetton can be obtained in the only way in the form of confirmation of the contribution to development.

4. Art - jetton, in the gallery space, to encourage the creative potential of participants.

The presence of 4 different jetton in the DAO economy will allow the introduction of various mechanisms to stimulate and encourage active users of the DAO. Various combinations of a combination of jetton in a certain amount can be developed, which will allow their holder to extract additional benefits. The mechanics of jetton circulation and additional incentives should be worked out collectively. We are at the beginning of our R&D for the decentralization of decision-making in the development of the DAO.

## Roles in TON CON DAO

This text contains the constitutive parameters of the role architecture in the TON CON DAO community. The key feature of the system is the meritocratic principle, the essence of which is to grant privileges to DAO participants exclusively for certain merits.

The basis for having a status in TON CON DAO is the participation of a person in **TON CON.**

***A project is a temporary enterprise aimed at creating a unique product, service or result.***

Projects are created and submitted according to the established procedure: by appointment of the community; by a Core-team member or a Coordinator of directions in agreement with the community. The approval procedure is established by a separate act.

The roles in TON CON DAO are:

1. **User**. The User is not an active participant in existing Projects. He may be a major jetton holder or even a former Core-team member.
2. **Developer**. If the user is ready to contribute to the project, then with the first contribution he automatically becomes a developer. The developer participates in a mailing list for developers, which discusses everything related to contributions to the community. All developers influence the decision-making of the community, all criticize decisions and offer alternatives. The Developer is a DAO participant who performs a certain functional role within the Project. The developer must become a holder of the NFT DAO in order to obtain this status. External contractors doing work for TON CON DAO and not having CON jettons are not the Developer.
3. **Manager**. The Manager manages the Project implemented within the framework of TON CON DAO. The manager must become a DAO NFT holder in order to get this status. External contractors who perform work for TON CON DAO and do not have CON tokens are not Managers.
4. **Leader**. The leader directs a number of directions or solves complex tasks in different directions. The leader must become a DAO token holder in order to receive this status. The leader can be appointed by a vote of the TON CON DAO Council. The order of appointment of the Leader is established by a separate act.
5. **Core-team member**. The Core-team member manages the treasury and participates in making individual decisions, delegates the authority to act on behalf of TON CON DAO. A Core-team member can be appointed as a result of the approval of the candidate by the TON CON DAO Council, followed by the approval of the candidate by the TON CON DAO community. The procedure for approving the candidacy and its approval is established by a separate act.

DAO participants are added to the appropriate status groups in the Telegram TON CON DAO.

TON CON DAO appreciates any form of participation in the common cause. Some activists are not in active Projects. Therefore, the second scale of evaluation of TON CON DAO participants is the rank

Ranks:

1. **Entrant**. An observer of TON CON DAO public channels and a participant in discussions. Does not own CON tokens and does not hold positions in it.
2. **Member of TON CON DAO**. Any owner of the NFT TON CON DAO becomes a participant of the TON CON DAO, since the possession of the NFT gives the right to participate in the voting procedures of the TON CON DAO.
3. **Professional TON CON DAO.** A TON CON DAO professional is a person who has successfully completed the minimum program of TON CON DAO training courses. A Developer or Manager can also become a TON CON DAO professional.
4. **The TON CON DAO Council.** The TON CON DAO Council **** is a Leader, a Core-team Member, or another person who has been accepted into the TON CON DAO Council. The procedure for admission to the TON CON DAO Council is established by a separate act.

Additionally, a third parameter is introduced, which can be described as "merit". merits are of a qualitative nature and, like medals, have the purpose of preserving the memory of the great exploits of an individual DAO participant. The order of awarding medals and the method of their accounting is established by a separate act.
